# 🖥️ Matrix Console Animation 🎭

Very simple Matrix Rain project 👾

## 📜 Description

This fun little test project creates a Matrix-like animation in your console window, reminiscent of the iconic "digital rain" from The Matrix films. It's a fun way for me to test .NET 9 release candidate in a minimal way, using the `System.CommandLine` package. Should be cross platform, but tested on macOS Sequoia.
